# Image_captioning
This repo contains my 6th Semester image captioning project using keras and flickr30k image dataset

## Things I learnt
- LSTM
- RNNs
- Word Embeddings for word vector representation using glove
- Data generators to handle large data matrices
- Automatic Feature Engineering
- Transfer learning using InceptionV3
- Overfitting
- My gpu is not that good

*P.S. idk why I used 30k for just a POC... anyways yolo!*
